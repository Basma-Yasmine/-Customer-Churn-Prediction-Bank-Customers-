# -Customer-Churn-Prediction-Bank-Customers-

Project Overview: This project focuses on predicting whether a bank customer is likely to leave (churn) using supervised machine learning classification. The goal is to clean and preprocess customer data, encode categorical features, explore feature relationships, and train a model to predict churn.

Objective: 
Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank. 

Dataset: 
Name: Churn_Modelling 
Source: Kaggle 
Type: Tabular (CSV)

Technologies & Libraries: 
Python 
Pandas
